- review the references				OKish

CHAPTER 2:
Electronics
- noise part limited	ADDED
- noise of the current and charge amp - strong diff
- operation time, peaking time, 
- differences between the noise
- influence on the measurements that follow
- which noise part drives the precision of the result

CH 3 DONE:
- CCD lower than RD42 why?			OK
priming? reference the figure of priming	OK



CHAPTER 4:
-pseudo-eff difference of estimate - compare MSBM-03 testbeam vs test stand
our opartion conditions si 100% efficienc. 
when you see 95, diff between pseudoeff and eff due to the setup is 5% or less


- 

Branching ratio of Americium 
distinguish from gammas and alphas		?
source data sheet				?
60 k gamma range higher than alpha		?
ratio between gamma and alpha should be		?

- alpha energy dist plot explain the gamma peak.		OK
- decay properties of americium source in the introduction.	
- energy dist of the gammas - what do you expect from the source? 
 
-landau dist should have a long tail, but does not. Saturation? Where are they? Simulation
landau and superimpose.

- tritium peak, alpha peak, expected. 


FIX PLOTS IN CH 3:
- vs Fluence (on all)					OK
- Proportionality factor for electrons and holes 	OK
- superimpose Hendrikâ€™s plot of charge vs temp
-more thorough on the description of figure  3.9
-dose values in the current pulses			OK
-approval of atlas plots. cc doug.
