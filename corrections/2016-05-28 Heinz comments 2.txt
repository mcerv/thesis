Basic noise mechanisms and characteristics
- Thermal - velocity fluc
	- assumption: A uniform across frequencies
	- 
- Shot - number fluc
- Flicker - charge trapping



Capacitance and its effect on S/N
- in current amp: C up, peak voltage down.
- in charge amp: C up, noise up

v^2 = integral of voltage density e^2
