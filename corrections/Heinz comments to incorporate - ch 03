Red points in ch. 03

Levels: 1-easy, 2-medium, 3-hard

Page	Level	Description
all		References DONE
 5	1	Include electrode info in the table
 8	1	Add schematics
10	2	7-How does ion. rad. degrade sensors? Diamonds specifically. Energy level
		in band gap -> leakage; charge trapping -> space charge & field;
10	2	Noise for charge sensitive amplifier - shot noise is important as well as
		dependance on detector capacitance. See Spielerâ€™s lectures! Expand in Ch2.
		Give the actual quantisation noise: thermal, capacitive etc as formulas
10	2	Explain the model for Q vs Flux 
11	2	What is equivalent fluence? Why does it relate to hardness factor?
12	1	Explain DPA -> see references
13	1	Revise the CCD to be at 1 V/um
14	1	Give stability in terms of deltaQ/Q in text
15	1	Revise the electron energy
16	3	Need to explain why efficiency drops. This is the most critical result
		from this measurement
17	2	The space charge region has to do with range of alpha, but NOT with one
		charge drifting. Mention that space charge causes polarisation field which
		contracts applied field.
19	3	The space charge is neutralised how?
20	1	40%? where from?
20	1	Move text.
24	3	What is the interpretation of the difference in charge collection at
		different temps in terms of exitons and charge traps?
