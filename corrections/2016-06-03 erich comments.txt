Unfortunately?
Relative expressions? Big, small… 

references to pictures

redo the figure 4.13					OK
two figures - collision and beam background.

Test
Measured in LHC - refer to paper with bunch structure	OK

Intro: principle of charge monitoring

schematics	
diamond det
lv readout, readout on lv side.
capacitively connect the amp






Current monitoring
comption scattering

form factor	- how do we define it? explain.

spectrum of 4alpha source
quadruple alpha source containing a, b, c, d		OK

do NOT USE CHIPPED-OFF SOURCE.				OK
electrons holes colour					OK

explain the pulses					OK

classes of current signals readout			OK
a el drift
b h drift
c elecs
d gamma = d
e neutron
f protons

elastic - pum paf
inelastic - scattering

neutron interaction always accompanied by a gamma
introduction: expect the graphs 			OK
use scvd	

proton recoil vs FWHM vs area				OK

1 pg explanation for each figure. 			OK

area —> fC

bibilography fix					OK
