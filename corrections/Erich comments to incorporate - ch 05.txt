Chapter 05

- Device specifications
- More in-depth block diagrams
- Describe multiplexing - 256bit into 32 sam
- Show the connectivity A/D —> FPGA …
- Pulse params:
	- Show a reference pulse with parameters
	- Fall slope show continuous difference of consecutive samples
	- Prominent diagrams, optcally appealing, unified
- Don’t mention the Picoscope.
- Diagrams - grid?

- scientific work left out
- too much like a tech report
- discussion of a signal shape in theory/practice. Include neutrons
- Derive 13.6 eV from pulse area

SOURCE CALIBRATION
- Particle signature - reference, plot
- Selective spectroscopy
- Single source compares to theory
- Teach the reader about the complexity
- Characterisation of int er. measured by the instrument similar for Beta and Alpha
- 0 amplitude qn the baseline of the pulse
- Little energy deposited
- 2.88 fC —>
- 60 fC —> 
- Show that only N/2 is collected for alpha
- neutron ballistic centre show
- Range because Landau
- Landau - starts at 2/3, ends at 10 MPV
- Remove Berilium from Calibration
- Calibration:
   - Energy plot.
   - beta,gamma same, therefore take beta

NOISE
- min. el. noise? thermal noise of a 50ohm sqrt(4ktBR)
	- R=50ohm, B=1GHz, T=300k, eg. open loop voltage of the current source
- internal trigger
- U x Aamp -> intrinsic noise in mV
- Noise considerations
- calculate noise
- compare
- eq. input noise current EINC (0.3 uA)
- provided by 50ohm thermal source

- calculate MPV from Ramo i=Qv/d=Q/td
- RMS noise at 0.3 uA
- MPV peak 1.2 uA -> how many sigma away? -> cannot trigger -> only at 5 RMS (5sigma); 2 uA
- only measuring tail of landau
- show landau and gaussian in the same plot
- Beta meas for pulse shapes
- show a nice alpha and beta particle 
- discuss what the reader sees
- what do I want to teach the reader?
- FormFactor: why such? how is it ideal? why does the plot looke like it doues?
- why is there a difference between alpha and beta?
- derive a scientific output
- theory
- meas
- deal cases for 2 types of interaction.
- prove understanding of the principle of interactions
- every alpha can to gamma emission -> electron-like emission.

NEUTRON MEAS
- domain of the application of the method
- derive criteria
- FF: useful : set thresholds to ….
- optimised set of qualifiers is…
- PuBe - decision on one set of quals?
- RT PSD
- discuss total spectrum. Draw on the pots.
- Prepare the reader from calibration for use in neutrons.
- Show on 2 pages: all pulses, selected pulses
- what do i want to show?
- present only 1 example
- complex triggering unit WRT identification of particles
- according to ionisation profile in diamonds via read out current -> gives us possibility to analyse in RT pulse shapes -> estimate the type of interaction a, b, g, n
- Show landau beta, gauss alpha, landau gamma, pulse shapes.
- start with thermal neutrons - easy. explain. Pavel’s publication - refer. Show 1-D also. Put this in realtime! Motivation: flux 
- Motivation n+: known that by selecting … the cleanest meas. (nuclear fusion) is crucial for temperature measurement of neutron plasma confinement of 14MeV n+. (fusion fuel)
- Confinement best measured in the centre (4 ns)
- Many parasitic signals
- Combination of Width and FormFactor provides a slection for this interaction in BallisticCentre
-Refer to Christina -> motivation C12, C13
- 14MEV measured via C12

LIMITS
- noise
- triggering
- energy deposition higher than …
- timing resolution
  - area calculation
- count rate

- Check Recoil protons (absorbed in diamond)
- how to get them?
- rejection efficiency


1) gamma background rejection -> flux
2) select 14MeV neutrons -> temperature in ITER
3) select recoil protons
4) select n+, but only 1-2 MeV -> flux of n+. academic motivation.
