When freezing:

- Analysis still ongoing


- wren counter increasing

- fifo seems to be filling
- during readout we get deadbeef. therefore:
	- s_read_fifo seems to be off
	- read_en_i off
	- s_raw_signal_to_usb_en
	- s_usb_write_fifo_en_d1
	- s_usb_write_fifo_en
	- s_fsm_usbfifo_wren
	- usbfifo_wren_o is off.
	- FSM FIFO: either
		- WAITEMPTY
		- IDLE
how does the usbfifo get reset?


SOLUTION 1:
- disable and re-enable PSA_RAW_SIG_HANDLER_ENABLE
s_PSA_status(0) <= s_raw_fifo_empty; -- MATEVZ ADDED 2016-06-13

RANDOM ERRORS - MAYBE DUE TO THE TRIGGER????
