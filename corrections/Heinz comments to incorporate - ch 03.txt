Red points in ch. 03

Levels: 1-easy, 2-medium, 3-hard

Page	Level	Description
all		References
 5	1 done?	Include electrode info in the table  DONE?
 8	1 	Add schematics 
10	2 meh..	7-How does ion. rad. degrade sensors? Diamonds specifically. Energy level
		in band gap -> leakage; charge trapping -> space charge & field;
20	1 done	Move text. DONE
20	1 done	40%? where from? DONE
10	2 meh..	Explain the model for Q vs Flux 
11	2 meh..	What is equivalent fluence? Why does it relate to hardness factor?
12	1 done	Explain DPA -> see references DONE
13	1 done	Revise the CCD to be at 1 V/um DONE
14	1 done	Give stability in terms of deltaQ/Q in text DONE
15	1 ?	Revise the electron energy 

same:
16	3	Need to explain why efficiency drops. This is the most critical result
		from this measurement
17	2	The space charge region has to do with range of alpha, but NOT with one
		charge drifting. Mention that space charge causes polarisation field which
		contracts applied field.
19	3	The space charge is neutralised how?
24	3 	What is the interpretation of the difference in charge collection at
		different temps in terms of excitons and charge traps?




For chapter 2:
10	2	Noise for charge sensitive amplifier - shot noise is important as well as
		dependance on detector capacitance. See Spielerâ€™s lectures! Expand in Ch2.
		Give the actual quantisation noise: thermal, capacitive etc as formulas
