Semiconductor-based neutron detectors provide a compact technology for neutron detection. However, the cross section of a neutron with the diamond bulk is very low, since it only interacts with the core of the atom. Diamond is mainly used to detect charged particles and photons. 

Research neutron reactors radiate a mix of particles, apart from neutrons also photons. The photons are considered a background radiation, concealing the neutron spectrum. When measured with diamond, the signal from neutrons is difficult to distinguish from the photon spectrum. In addition, low energy neutrons do not cause nuclear reactions in the bulk. All in all, the neutron measurements in a reactor present a challenge with diamond. However, by means of the PSA, the neutron signal can be discriminated from the photon background to some extent. The following two cases show how measurements of fast (n$^+$) and thermal (n$^-$) neutrons were carried out by making use of the PSA.

Note the changing scale on the X axis in the figures.
