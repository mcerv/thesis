My special appreciation and thanks go to to my advisors Dr. Heinz Pernegger and Dr. Erich Griesmayer. Your support of my work has been invaluable. In the past four years I have grown professionally as well as personally. By accepting me to the Marie Curie TALENT programme you allowed me to embark on a life-changing and eye-opening journey, which will definitely have a major impact on me in the years to come. I will take this opportunity to acknowledge that this work position at CERN was included in the Work Package 2 of the Marie Curie Early Initial Training Network Fellowship of the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme under contract number (PITN-GA-2011-289161- TALENT).

I would also like to thank Andrej and Marko. Without your selfless support during my early days as a researcher I would be where I am today. You gave me an insight into joys of particle physics research (i.e. playing around with expensive hardware), which gave rise to my increased interest in involvement with CERN.

Next I would like to extend my gratitude to my dear colleagues in the work groups: Jennifer, Sonia, Karola, Timon, Christian, Branislav, Simon, Doug, Malte, Hendrik and Pavel. You stood by my side in my days of sorrow when the measurement setup decided to punish me with abstract errors, you helped me fight the battles against segfaults, corrected my sloppy writing and, most importantly, you made sure we never ran out of much needed coffee and banter in the office. 

A big shout-out to all my Geneva friends. Our friendship has left a big mark on my life and I will never forget the fun, the music and all the great moments we spent together.

I am deeply thankful to my family for their love and support. Vida, Roman, you always believed in me and encouraged me on the path I chose and for this I will be forever indebted to you. Miha, Klemen, Ana, Meta, Zala, Julija, you are the best. Finally, I would like to thank Ur\v{s}ka. You have walked the path alongside me and supported me and made these years together ever so enjoyable.
